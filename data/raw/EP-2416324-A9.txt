<DESCRIPTION>
background of the invention field of the inventionthe disclosed invention relates to a semiconductor device including a semiconductor element and a method for driving the semiconductor device description of the related artstorage devices including semiconductor elements are broadly classified into two categories a volatile device that loses stored data when power is not supplied and a non volatile device that holds stored data even when power is not supplied a typical example of a volatile storage device is a dram dynamic random access memory a dram stores data in such a manner that a transistor included in a storage element is selected and electric charge is stored in a capacitor when data is read from a dram electric charge in a capacitor is lost owing to the above described principle thus another writing operation is necessary whenever data is read out moreover since leakage current off state current flows between a source and a drain of a transistor included in a storage element when the transistor is in an off state for example electric charge flows into or out even if the transistor is not selected which makes a data holding period short for that reason another writing operation refresh operation is necessary at predetermined intervals and it is difficult to sufficiently reduce power consumption furthermore since stored data is lost when power is not supplied an additional storage device using a magnetic material or an optical material is needed in order to hold the data for a long time another example of a volatile storage device is an sram static random access memory an sram holds stored data by using a circuit such as a flip flop and thus does not need a refresh operation this means that an sram has an advantage over a dram however cost per storage capacity is increased because a circuit such as a flip flop is used moreover as in a dram stored data in an sram is lost when power is not supplied a typical example of a non volatile storage device is a flash memory a flash memory includes a floating gate between a gate electrode and a channel formation region in a transistor and stores data by holding electric charge in the floating gate therefore a flash memory has advantages in that a data holding period is extremely long almost permanent and a refresh operation which is necessary in a volatile storage device is not needed e g see patent document however a gate insulating layer included in a storage element deteriorates by tunneling current generated in writing so that the storage element stops its function after a predetermined number of writing operations in order to alleviate an influence due to this problem a method in which the number of writing operations is equalized among storage elements can be employed for example but a complex peripheral circuit is needed to realize this method moreover employing such a method does not solve the fundamental problem of lifetime in other words a flash memory is not suitable for applications in which data is frequently rewritten in addition a high voltage is necessary in order to inject electric charge into a floating gate or remove the electric charge and a circuit therefor is also required further it takes a relatively long time to inject or remove the electric charge and it is not easy to perform writing and erasing at higher speed reference patent document patent document japanese published patent application no s summary of the inventionin view of the foregoing problem it is an object of an embodiment of the disclosed invention to provide a

second drain electrode and one electrode of the capacitor are electrically connected to each other to form a node where electric charge is held the bit line the first drain electrode and the second source electrode are electrically connected to each other one terminal of the potential switching circuit the source line and the first source electrode are electrically connected to each other the write read word line and the other electrode of the capacitor are electrically connected to each other the write word line and the second gate electrode are electrically connected to each other the potential switching circuit has a function of selectively supplying a power supply potential to the source line in a writing period another embodiment of the disclosed invention is a semiconductor device including a write word line a write read word line a bit line a source line a potential switching circuit and a memory cell array including a plurality of memory cells one of the plurality of memory cells includes a first transistor which is an n channel transistor a second transistor and a capacitor the first transistor includes a first gate electrode a first source electrode a first drain electrode and a first channel formation region the second transistor includes a second gate electrode a second source electrode a second drain electrode and a second channel formation region the first channel formation region and the second channel formation region include semiconductor materials that are different from each other the first gate electrode the second drain electrode and one electrode of the capacitor are electrically connected to each other to form a node where electric charge is held the bit line the first drain electrode and the second source electrode are electrically connected to each other one terminal of the potential switching circuit the source line and the first source electrode are electrically connected to each other the write read word line and the other electrode of the capacitor are electrically connected to each other the write word line and the second gate electrode are electrically connected to each other the source line is electrically connected to the plurality of memory cells in a plurality of columns the potential switching circuit has a function of selectively supplying a power supply potential to the source line in a writing period in any of the above semiconductor devices the second channel formation region of the second transistor preferably includes an oxide semiconductor another embodiment of the disclosed invention is a method for driving a semiconductor device in which a gate electrode of a first transistor a drain electrode of a second transistor and one electrode of a capacitor are electrically connected to each other to form a node where electric charge is held including the step of supplying a power supply potential to a source electrode of the first transistor when a potential at which the first transistor is turned on is supplied to the node in the above method for driving a semiconductor device a channel formation region of the first transistor includes a semiconductor material different from a semiconductor material of a channel formation region of the second transistor in the above method for driving a semiconductor device the channel formation region of the second transistor preferably includes an oxide semiconductor in the above method for driving a semiconductor device an operation in which the power supply potential is supplied to the source electrode of the first transistor is performed by controlling a potential of the source line connected to the source electrode of the first transistor with the use of a potential switching circuit in this specification and the like the term such as electrode or wiring does not limit a function of such a component for example an electrode is sometimes used as part of a wiring and vice versa furthermore the term electrode or wiring can include the case where a plurality of electrodes or wirings are formed in an integrated manner functions of source and drain are sometimes replaced with each other when a transistor of opposite polarity is used or when the direction of current flowing is changed in a circuit operation for example therefore the terms source and drain can also be used to denote the drain and the source respectively in this specification note that in this specification and the like the term electrically connected includes the case where components are connected to each other through an object having any electric function there is no particular limitation on the object having any electric function as long as electric signals can be transmitted and received between the components that are connected through the object examples of the object having any electric function include a switching element such as a transistor a resistor an inductor a capacitor and elements with a variety of functions as well as an electrode and a wiring in addition the ordinal numbers such as first and second in this specification and the like are used for convenience and do not denote the order of steps and the stacking order of layers further the ordinal numbers in this specification and the like do not denote any particular names to define the invention furthermore the ordinal numbers are used in order to avoid confusion among components and the terms do not limit the components numerically since the off state current of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor is extremely small stored data can be held for an extremely long time by using the transistor in other words power consumption can be adequately reduced because a refresh operation becomes unnecessary or the frequency of refresh operations can be extremely low moreover stored data can be held for a long time even when power is not supplied note that the potential is preferably fixed further a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the disclosed invention does not need a high voltage for writing of data and there is no problem of deterioration of elements for example unlike a conventional non volatile memory it is not necessary to inject and extract electrons into and from a floating gate and thus a problem such as deterioration of a gate insulating layer does not occur at all in other words the semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the disclosed invention does not have a limitation on the number of times of writing operations which is a problem in a conventional non volatile memory and reliability thereof is drastically improved furthermore data is written depending on an on state and an off state of a transistor whereby a high speed operation can be easily realized in addition there is no need of an operation for erasing data since a transistor including a material other than an oxide semiconductor can operate at sufficiently high speed a semiconductor device can perform an operation e g reading data at sufficiently high speed by combining such a transistor with a transistor including an oxide semiconductor further with the use of a transistor including a material other than an oxide semiconductor a variety of circuits such as a logic circuit or a driver circuit which are required to operate at high speed can be real ized brief description of the

embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings note that the present invention is not limited to the following description and it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details thereof can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention therefore the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the description in the following embodiments note that the position the size the range or the like of each structure illustrated in drawings and the like is not accurately represented in some cases for easy understanding therefore the disclosed invention is not necessarily limited to the position the size the range or the like as disclosed in the drawings and the like embodiment in this embodiment a basic circuit structure and operation of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the disclosed invention will be described with reference to figs a a and b and fig note that in each of circuit diagrams in some cases os is written beside a transistor in order to indicate that the transistor includes an oxide semiconductor basic circuit first the most basic circuit structure and its operation will be described with reference to figs a a and b in a semiconductor device illustrated in fig a a first wiring a first line and a source electrode or a drain electrode of a transistor are electrically connected to each other and a second wiring a second line and the drain electrode or the source electrode of the transistor are electrically connected to each other in addition a third wiring a third line and a source electrode or a drain electrode of a transistor are electrically connected to each other and a fourth wiring a fourth line and a gate electrode of the transistor are electrically connected to each other in addition a gate electrode of the transistor and the drain electrode or the source electrode of the transistor are electrically connected to one electrode of a capacitor and a fifth wiring a fifth line and the other electrode of the capacitor are electrically connected to each other here a transistor including an oxide semiconductor is used as the transistor for example a transistor including an oxide semiconductor has a characteristic of a significantly small off state current for that reason a potential of the gate electrode of the transistor can be held for an extremely long time by turning off the transistor provision of the capacitor facilitates holding of electric charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor and reading of held data as the transistor an n channel transistor can be used and there is no particular limitation on a semiconductor material used for the transistor in terms of increasing the speed of reading data it is preferable to use for example a transistor with a high switching rate such as a transistor formed using single crystal silicon in addition a structure in which the capacitor is not provided as illustrated in fig b can be employed the semiconductor device illustrated in fig a utilizes a characteristic in which the potential of the gate electrode of the transistor can be held thereby writing storing and reading data as follows first writing and holding of data will be described first the potential of the fourth line is set to a potential at which the transistor is turned on so that the transistor is turned on accordingly the potential of the third line is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor and the capacitor that is predetermined electric charge is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor writing here one of electric charges for supplying two different potentials hereinafter electric charge for supplying a low potential is referred to as electric charge ql and electric charge for supplying a high potential is referred to as electric charge qh is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor note that electric charges for supplying three or more different potentials may be used to improve storage capacity after that the potential of the fourth line is set to a potential at which the transistor is turned off so that the transistor is turned off thus the electric charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor is held holding since the off state current of the transistor is extremely small the electric charge in the gate electrode of the transistor is held for a long time next reading of data will be described by supplying an appropriate potential reading potential to the fifth line while a predetermined potential constant potential is supplied to the first line the potential of the second line varies depending on the quantity of electric charge held in the gate electrode of the transistor this is because in general when the transistor is an n channel transistor an apparent threshold voltage vth_h in the case where qh is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor is lower than an apparent threshold voltage vth_l in the case where ql is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor here an apparent threshold voltage refers to the potential of the fifth line which is needed to turn on the transistor thus by setting the potential of the fifth line to a potential v intermediate between vth_h and vth_l the electric charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor can be determined for example in the case where qh is supplied in writing when the potential of the fifth line is set to v vth_h the transistor is turned on in the case where ql is supplied in writing even when the potential of the fifth line is set to v vth_l the transistor remains off therefore the held data can be read by recognizing the potential of the second line note that in the case where memory cells are arrayed to be used only data of a desired memory cell is needed to be read in order that data of a predetermined memory cell is read and data of the other memory cells is not read in the case where the transistors of the memory cells are connected in parallel fifth lines in the memory cells that are not a target for reading are supplied with a potential at which the transistors are turned off regardless of the state of gate electrodes that is a potential lower than vth_h on the other hand in the case where the transistors of the memory cells are connected in series the fifth lines in the memory cells that are not a target for reading are supplied with a potential at which the transistors are turned on regardless of the state of the gate electrodes that is a potential higher than vth_l then rewriting of data will be described rewriting of data is performed in a manner similar to that of the writing and holding of data that is the potential of the fourth line is set to a potential at which the transistor is turned on so that the transistor is turned on accordingly the potential of the third line potential related to new data is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor and the capacitor after that the potential of the fourth line is set to a potential at which the transistor is turned off so that the transistor is turned off accordingly electric charge related to new data is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor in the semiconductor device according to the disclosed invention data can be directly rewritten by another writing of data as described above therefore extracting of electric charge from a floating gate with the use of a high voltage needed in a flash memory or the like is not necessary and thus reduction in operation speed which is attributed to an erasing operation can be suppressed in other words a high speed operation of the semiconductor device can be realized note that the drain electrode or the source electrode of the transistor is electrically connected to the gate electrode of the transistor and thereby an effect similar to that of a floating gate of a floating gate transistor which is used for a non volatile memory element is achieved hereinafter a portion where the drain electrode or the source electrode of the transistor and the gate electrode of the transistor are electrically connected to each other is called a node fg in some cases when the transistor is off the node fg can be regarded as being embedded in an insulator and electric charge is held in the node fg the off state current of the transistor including an oxide semiconductor is less than or equal to one hundred thousandth of the off state current of a transistor including a silicon semiconductor or the like thus loss of the electric charge stored in the node fg due to leakage current of the transistor is negligible that is with the transistor including an oxide semiconductor a non volatile storage device which can hold data even when power is not supplied can be realized for example when the off state current of the transistor is less than or equal to za za zeptoampere is × a at room temperature c and the capacitance value of the capacitor is approximately ff data can be held for greater than or equal to seconds it is needless to say that the holding time depends on the transistor characteristics and the capacitance value further the semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the disclosed invention does not have the problem of deterioration of a gate insulating layer a tunnel insulating film which has been a problem of a conventional floating gate transistor that is the problem of deterioration of a gate insulating layer due to injection of electrons into a floating gate which has been regarded as a problem can be solved this means that there is no limitation on the number of times of writing operations in principle furthermore a high voltage needed for writing or erasing of data in a conventional floating gate transistor is not necessary the components such as the transistors in the semiconductor device in fig a can be regarded as including a resistor and a capacitor as illustrated in fig a that is in fig a the transistor and the capacitor are each regarded as including a resistor and a capacitor r and c denote the resistance value and the capacitance value of the capacitor respectively the resistance value r corresponds to a resistance value which depends on an insulating layer included in the capacitor r and c denote the resistance value and the capacitance value of the transistor respectively the resistance value r corresponds to a resistance value which depends on a gate insulating layer at the time when the transistor is on the capacitance value c corresponds to a capacitance value of so called gate capacitance capacitance formed between the gate electrode and the source electrode or the drain electrode and capacitance formed between the gate electrode and the channel formation region an electric charge holding period also referred to as a data holding period is determined mainly by the off state current of the transistor under the condition that gate leakage current of the transistor is sufficiently small r is greater than or equal to ros r ≥ ros and r is greater than or equal to ros r ≥ ros where ros is the resistance value also referred to as effective resistance value between the source electrode and the drain electrode at the time when the transistor is off when the above condition is not met it is difficult to sufficiently secure the holding period even if the off state current of the transistor is sufficiently small this is because leakage current other than the off state current of the transistor e g leakage current generated between the source electrode and the gate electrode is large accordingly it can be said that it is preferable that the semiconductor device disclosed in this embodiment satisfy the above relations of r ≥ ros and r ≥ ros it is desirable that c and c satisfy c ≥ c c is greater than or equal to c this is because by increasing c the potential of the fifth line can be effectively supplied to the node fg when the potential of the node fg is controlled by the fifth line and thus the difference between the potentials supplied to the fifth line e g a potential for reading and a potential for non reading can be reduced as described above when the above relations are satisfied a more favorable semiconductor device can be realized note that r and r are controlled by the gate insulating layer of the transistor and the insulating layer of the capacitor the same applies to c and c therefore the material the thickness and the like of the gate insulating layer are desirably set as appropriate to satisfy the above relation in the semiconductor device described in this embodiment the node fg has an effect similar to a floating gate of a floating gate transistor in a flash memory or the like but the node fg of this embodiment has a feature which is essentially different from that of a floating gate in a flash memory or the like in a flash memory since a potential applied to a control gate is high it is necessary to keep a proper distance between cells in order to prevent the potential from affecting a floating gate of the adjacent cell this is one of inhibiting factors for higher integration of the semiconductor device the factor is attributed to a basic principle of a flash memory in which tunneling current is made to flow by applying a high electrical field in contrast the semiconductor device according to this embodiment is operated by switching of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor and does not use the above described principle of electric charge injection by tunneling current that is a high electrical field for electric charge injection is not necessary unlike a flash memory accordingly it is not necessary to consider an influence of a high electrical field from a control gate on the adjacent cell which facilitates higher integration in addition it is also advantageous that a high electric field is unnecessary and a large peripheral circuit such as a step up circuit is unnecessary as compared to a flash memory for example the highest voltage applied to the memory cell according to this embodiment the difference between the highest potential and the lowest potential applied to terminals of the memory cell at the same time can be less than or equal to v preferably less than or equal to v in each memory cell in the case where two levels one bit of data are written in the case where the relative permittivity εr of the insulating layer included in the capacitor is made different from the relative permittivity εr of the insulating layer included in the transistor c can easily be made greater than or equal to c c ≥ c while s which is the area of the insulating layer included in the capacitor and s which is the area of the insulating layer forming gate capacitance of the transistor satisfy a relation where · s is greater than or equal to s · s ≥ s desirably s is greater than or equal to s s ≥ s that is it is easy to satisfy c ≥ c while the area of the insulating layer included in the capacitor is made small specifically for example a film formed of a high k material such as hafnium oxide or a stack of a film formed of a high k material such as hafnium oxide and a film formed of an oxide semiconductor is used for the insulating layer included in the capacitor so that εr can be greater than or equal to preferably greater than or equal to and silicon oxide is used for the insulating layer forming the gate capacitance of the transistor so that εr can be to combination of such structures enables higher integration of the semiconductor device according to the disclosed invention note that in addition to the increase in the degree of integration a multilevel technique can be employed in order to increase the storage capacity of the semiconductor device for example three or more levels of data are written into one memory cell whereby the storage capacity can be increased as compared to that in the case where two level one bit data is written the multilevel technique can be achieved by for example supplying electric charge q for supplying another level of potential to the gate electrode of the transistor in addition to electric charge ql for supplying a low potential and electric charge qh for supplying a high potential in this case sufficient storage capacity can be ensured even in a circuit structure with a relatively large scale e g f to f f is the minimum feature size basic circuit next a more specific circuit structure and its operation will be described with reference to fig fig illustrates a structure in which two memory cells are arranged in the row direction a structure of a memory cell illustrated in fig is similar to that in fig a that is the first line in fig a corresponds to a source line sl in fig the fourth line in fig a corresponds to a write word line osg in fig the fifth line in fig a corresponds to a write read word line c in fig both the second line and the third line in fig a correspond to a bit line bl in fig in fig the source line sl is used for the memory cells in a plurality of columns e g two columns in fig the number of columns for which one source line sl is used is not limited to and one source line sl may be used for memory cells in three or more columns in addition one source line sl may be used for memory cells in a plurality of rows or for memory cells in a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows in fig the source line sl is connected to a source line switching circuit here the source line switching circuit is connected to a write enable bar signal line web as well as to the source line sl the write enable bar signal line web transmits to the source line switching circuit a signal for switching a signal path by the control of a writing period or a reading period writing holding and reading of data are performed in a manner similar to that in the case of figs a a and b here as an example the case where either a power supply potential vdd or a reference potential gnd is supplied to the node fg will be described note that data is held when the power supply potential vdd is supplied to the node fg whereas data is held when the reference potential gnd is supplied to the node fg a specific writing operation is as follows first a potential of the write read word line c connected to the memory cell is set to gnd and a potential of the write word line osg connected to the memory cell is set to vdd whereby the memory cell is selected accordingly the potential of the bit line bl is supplied to the node fg of the selected memory cell here in the case where the power supply potential vdd is supplied to the node fg i e in the case where data is held a potential at which the transistor is turned on is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor in that case the potential of the source line sl needs to be set to the power potential vdd in order to suppress decrease in potential written into the node fg due to current flowing in the bit line bl and the source line sl in that case with a signal transmitted from the write enable bar signal line web a signal path in the source line switching circuit is switched that is a signal with which a writing operation can be performed is input to the write enable bar signal line web and the signal path in the source line switching circuit is switched whereby the power supply potential vdd is supplied to the source line sl the operation is characterized in that the potential of the source line sl is set to the power supply potential vdd when data is written this can suppress generation of current flowing in the bit line bl and the source line sl even when the potential at which the transistor is turned on is supplied to the node fg note that in the case where data is written into the memory cell gnd is supplied to the bit line bl in the case where data is written into the memory cell the potential of the bit line bl is set to vdd note that when data is written into the memory cell vdd vth_os is supplied to the bit line bl so that the potential of the node fg is not reduced from vdd by the threshold voltage of the transistor vth_os alternatively the write word line osg may have a high potential vh a potential higher than the sum of the potential of the bit line bl and vth_os data is held in such a manner that the write read word line c and the write word line osg are each set to a potential vl lower than gnd by vdd when the potential of the write read word line c is decreased to vl from gnd the potential of the node fg is decreased by gnd vl vdd by capacitive coupling with the capacitor accordingly when vdd corresponding to data has been supplied to the node fg the potential of the node fg is decreased by vdd to be gnd whereas when gnd corresponding to data has been supplied to the node fg the potential of the node fg is decreased by vdd to be gnd vdd vl since vl has been supplied to the write word line osg the transistor is turned off regardless of whether data or data has been written since the off state current of the transistor is significantly small the electric charge of the gate electrode of the transistor is held for a long time data is read by setting the potential of the write read word line c to gnd and the potential of the write word line osg to vl when the potential of the write read word line c is increased to gnd from vl the potential of the node fg is increased by gnd vl vdd by capacitive coupling with the capacitor accordingly when data has been written in the node fg the potential of the node fg is increased by vdd to be vdd on the other hand when data has been written in the node fg the potential of the node fg is increased by vdd to be vl vdd gnd in the reading operation with a signal transmitted from the write enable bar signal line web the signal path in the source line switching circuit is switched through the above operation gnd is supplied to the source line sl by the above reading operation if data has been written into the memory cell the transistor is turned on and the potential of the bit line bl is decreased if data has been written the transistor is turned off and the potential of the bit line bl is maintained at the level at the beginning of reading or is increased as described above in the semiconductor device having the circuit structure illustrated in fig the area of the memory cell array can be reduced by sharing the source line sl by memory cells in a plurality of columns accordingly the die size can be reduced moreover the reduction in the die size allows cost reduction in manufacturing the semiconductor device or improvement in yield

thereto may be employed the data input signal line din corresponds to a terminal to which data to be written into the memory cell is input the data output signal line dout corresponds to a terminal from which data that has been written into the memory cell is output one or more data input signal lines din and data output signal lines dout are provided and the number of these lines depends on the circuit structure of the first driver circuit alternatively a data input output signal line serving as both the data input signal line din and the data output signal line dout may be employed the data input output signal line has both a function of input of data to be written into the memory cell and a function of output of data that has been written into the memory cell the address selection signal line a corresponds to a terminal to which a signal for selecting an address of the memory cell is input one or more address selection signal lines a are provided and the number of the address selection signal lines a depends on the number of rows and the number of columns of the memory cells the circuit structure of the first driver circuit the circuit structure of the second driver

memory cell in the first row and the n th column data is written into the memory cell in the m th row and the first column and data is written into the memory cell in the m th row and the n th column and then the written data in all the above memory cells is read out in a writing period the chip enable bar signal line ceb and the write enable bar signal line web are set to a low potential and an address of the memory cell to which data is written is specified by a signal from the address selection signal line a whereby a state in which writing can be performed is made then data is input from

the bit line bl in the case of writing of data has a low potential note that a signal input period of the bit line bl is set so as to be longer than that of the write word line osg in a selected row and the write read word line c in a selected row for the following reason if the signal input period of the bit line bl is short incorrect writing of data to the memory cell might be caused in a reading period the chip enable bar signal line ceb and the read enable bar signal line reb are set to a low potential and an address of the memory cell from which data is read is specified by a signal from the address selection signal line a whereby a state in which reading can be performed is made data which has been read from the memory cell via the bit line bl is output from the first driver circuit to the data output signal line dout a high potential is output from the second driver circuit to the write read word line c in a selected row the write word line osg has a low potential regardless of a selected state or a non selected state in the reading period a potential corresponding to the data which has been written into the memory cell is output to the bit line bl in accordance with the timing of row selection the bit line bl has a low potential when data has been written into the memory cell whereas the bit line bl has a high potential when data has been written into the memory cell in a standby and data holding period the chip enable bar signal line ceb is set to a high potential e g a power supply potential so that the memory cell is in a non selected state

is a cross sectional view of the semiconductor device and fig b is a plan view of the semiconductor device fig a corresponds to a cross section along line a a and line b b in fig b the semiconductor device illustrated in figs a and b includes a transistor including a first semiconductor material in a lower portion and a transistor including a second semiconductor material in an upper portion here the first semiconductor material and the second semiconductor material are preferably different materials for example a semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor can be used as the

germanium silicon germanium silicon carbide gallium arsenide or the like and is preferably a single crystal semiconductor alternatively an organic semiconductor material or the like may be used a transistor including such a semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor can operate at high speed easily on the other hand a transistor including an oxide semiconductor can hold electric charge for a long time owing to its characteristics the semiconductor device in figs a and b can be used as a memory cell since the technical nature of the disclosed invention is to use a semiconductor material with which off state current can be sufficiently decreased such as an oxide semiconductor in the transistor so that data can be held it is not necessary to limit a specific structure of the semiconductor device such as a material of the semiconductor device or a structure of the semiconductor device to those described here the transistor in figs a and b includes a channel formation region provided in a semiconductor layer over a semiconductor substrate impurity regions also referred to as a source region and a drain region with the channel formation region provided therebetween a gate insulating layer a provided over the channel formation region and a gate electrode a provided over the gate insulating layer a so as to overlap with the channel formation region note that a transistor whose source electrode and drain electrode are not illustrated in a drawing is referred to as a transistor for the sake of convenience in some cases further in such a case in description of a connection of a transistor a source region and a source electrode are collectively referred to as a source electrode and a drain region and a drain electrode are collectively referred to as a drain electrode that is in this specification the term source electrode may include a source region also the term drain electrode may include a drain region further a conductive layer b is connected to an impurity region provided in the semiconductor layer over the semiconductor substrate here the conductive layer b functions as a source electrode or a drain electrode of the transistor in addition an impurity region is provided between the impurity region and the impurity region further insulating layers and are provided so as to cover the transistor note that for higher integration it is preferable that as in figs a and b the transistor does not have a sidewall insulating layer however when importance is put on the characteristics of the transistor sidewall insulating layers may be provided on side surfaces of the gate electrode a and the impurity region may include a region with a different impurity concentration the transistor in figs a and b includes an oxide semiconductor layer which is provided over the insulating layer and the like a source electrode or a drain electrode a and a drain electrode or a source electrode b which are electrically connected to the oxide semiconductor layer a gate insulating layer which covers the oxide semiconductor layer the source electrode a and the drain electrode b and a gate electrode a which is provided over the gate insulating layer so as to overlap with the oxide semiconductor layer here the oxide semiconductor layer is preferably a highly purified oxide semiconductor layer obtained by sufficiently removing impurities such as hydrogen or sufficiently supplying oxygen specifically the hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer is less than or equal to × atoms/cm preferably less than or equal to × atoms/cm more preferably less than or equal to × atoms/cm note that the hydrogen concentration of the oxide semiconductor layer is measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry sims in the oxide semiconductor layer which is highly purified by sufficiently reducing the hydrogen concentration and in which defect levels in an energy gap due to oxygen deficiency are reduced by sufficiently supplying oxygen the carrier concentration is less than × /cm preferably less than × /cm more preferably less than × /cm for example the off state current here current per micrometer µm of channel

oxide semiconductor or a substantially i type oxide semiconductor the transistor which has extremely favorable off state current characteristics can be obtained note that although the transistor in figs a and b includes the oxide semiconductor layer which is processed into an island shape in order to suppress leakage current between elements which is caused due to miniaturization the oxide semiconductor layer which is not processed into an island shape may be employed in the case where the oxide semiconductor layer is not processed into an island shape contamination of the oxide semiconductor layer due to etching in the processing can be prevented a capacitor in figs a and b includes the drain electrode a the gate insulating layer and a conductive layer b that is to say the drain electrode b functions as one electrode of the capacitor and the conductive layer b functions as the other electrode of the capacitor with such a structure sufficient capacitance can be secured further in the capacitor insulating properties between the drain electrode b and the conductive layer b can be adequately secured by stacking the oxide semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer further alternatively the capacitor may be omitted in the case where a capacitor is not needed in this embodiment the transistor and the capacitor are provided so as to overlap with the transistor at least partly by employing such a planar layout higher integration can be realized for example given that the minimum feature size is f the area of a memory cell can be f to f an insulating layer is provided over the transistor and the capacitor a wiring is provided in an opening formed in the gate insulating layer and the insulating layer the wiring is a wiring which connects one memory cell to another memory cell and corresponds to the bit line bl in the circuit diagram in fig the wiring is electrically connected to the impurity region through the source electrode a and the conductive layer b the above structure allows reduction in the number of wirings as compared to a structure in which the source region or the drain region in the transistor and the source

impurity region and the source electrode a are connected and a position where the source electrode a and the wiring are connected can overlap with each other with such a planar layout the element area can be prevented from increasing owing to contact regions in other words the degree of integration of the semiconductor device can be increased manufacturing method of soi substrate next an example of a method for manufacturing an soi substrate used for manufacturing the semiconductor device will be described with reference to figs a to g first the semiconductor substrate is prepared as a base substrate see fig a as the semiconductor substrate a semiconductor substrate such as a single crystal silicon substrate or a single crystal germanium substrate can be used in addition as the semiconductor substrate a solar grade silicon sog si substrate or the like may be used alternatively a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate may be used in the case of using a sog si substrate a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate or the like manufacturing cost can be reduced as compared to the case of using a single crystal silicon substrate or the like in stead of the semiconductor substrate a variety of glass substrates used in electronic industries such as a substrate of aluminosilicate glass aluminoborosilicate glass or barium borosilicate glass a quartz substrate a ceramic substrate or a sapphire substrate can be used further a ceramic substrate which contains silicon nitride and aluminum nitride as its main components and whose coefficient of thermal expansion is close to that of silicon may be used a surface of the semiconductor substrate is preferably cleaned in advance specifically the semiconductor substrate is subjected to cleaning with a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture hpm a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture spm an ammonium hydrogen peroxide mixture apm diluted hydrofluoric acid dhf or the like next a bond substrate is prepared here a single crystal semiconductor substrate is used as the bond substrate see fig b note that although a substrate whose crystallinity is single crystal is used as the bond substrate here the crystallinity of the bond substrate is not necessarily limited to single crystal for example as the single crystal semiconductor substrate a single crystal semiconductor substrate formed using a group element such as a single crystal silicon substrate a single crystal germanium substrate or a single crystal silicon germanium substrate can be used further a compound semiconductor substrate using gallium arsenide indium phosphide or the like can be used typical examples of commercially available silicon substrates are circular silicon substrates which are inches mm in diameter inches mm in diameter inches mm in diameter inches mm in diameter and inches mm in diameter note that the shape of the single crystal semiconductor substrate is not limited to circular and the single crystal semiconductor substrate may be a substrate which is processed into for example a rectangular shape or the like further the single crystal semiconductor substrate can be formed by a czochralski cz method or a floating zone fz method an oxide film is formed on a surface of the single crystal semiconductor substrate see fig c in terms of removal of contamination it is preferable that the surface of the single crystal semiconductor substrate be cleaned with a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture hpm a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture spm an ammonium hydrogen peroxide mixture apm diluted hydrofluoric acid dhf fpm a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid hydrogen peroxide water and pure water or the like before the formation of the oxide film alternatively diluted hydrofluoric acid and ozone water may be discharged alternately to clean the surface of the single crystal semiconductor substrate the oxide film can be formed with for example a single layer or a stacked layer of a silicon oxide film a silicon oxynitride film and the like as a method for forming the oxide film a thermal oxidation method a cvd method a sputtering method or the like can be used when the oxide film is formed by a cvd method a silicon oxide film is preferably formed using organosilane such as tetraethoxysilane abbreviation teos chemical formula si oc h so that favorable bonding can be achieved in this embodiment the oxide film here a siox film is formed by performing thermal oxidation treatment on the single crystal semiconductor substrate the thermal oxidation treatment is preferably performed in an oxidizing atmosphere to which halogen is added for example thermal oxidation treatment is performed on the single crystal semiconductor substrate in an oxidizing atmosphere to which chlorine cl is added whereby the oxide film can be formed through chlorine oxidation in this case the oxide film is a film containing chlorine atoms by such chlorine oxidation heavy metal e g fe cr ni or mo that is an extrinsic impurity is trapped and chloride of the metal is formed and then removed to the outside thus contamination of the single crystal semiconductor substrate can be reduced note that halogen atoms contained in the oxide film are not limited to chlorine atoms fluorine atoms may be contained in the oxide film as a method for fluorine oxidation of the surface of the single crystal semiconductor substrate a method in which the single crystal semiconductor substrate is soaked in an hf solution and then subjected to thermal oxidation treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere a method in which thermal oxidation treatment is performed in an oxidizing atmosphere to which nf is added or the like can be used next ions are accelerated by an electric field and the single crystal semiconductor substrate is irradiated with the ions and the ions are added to the single crystal semiconductor substrate whereby an embrittled region where the crystal structure is damaged is formed in the single crystal semiconductor substrate at a predetermined depth see fig d the depth at which the embrittled region is formed can be adjusted by the kinetic energy mass electric charge or incidence angle of the ions or the like the embrittled region is formed at approximately the same depth as the average penetration depth of the ions therefore the thickness of a single crystal semiconductor layer to be separated from the single crystal semiconductor substrate can be adjusted by the depth at which the ions are added for example the average penetration depth may be controlled such that the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer is approximately greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm preferably greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm the above ion irradiation treatment can be performed with the use of an ion doping apparatus or an ion implantation apparatus as a typical example of the ion doping apparatus there is a non mass separation type apparatus in which plasma excitation of a process gas is performed and an object to be processed is irradiated with all kinds of ion species generated in this apparatus the object to be processed is irradiated with ion species of plasma without mass separation in contrast an ion implantation apparatus is a mass separation type apparatus in the ion implantation apparatus mass separation of ion species of plasma is performed and the object to be processed is irradiated with ion species having predetermined masses in this embodiment an example is described in which an ion doping apparatus is used to add hydrogen to the single crystal semiconductor substrate a gas containing hydrogen is used as a source gas as for ions used for the irradiation the proportion of h is preferably set high specifically it is preferable that the proportion of h be set to greater than or equal to more preferably greater than or equal to with respect to the total amount of h h and h with a high proportion of h the efficiency of ion irradiation can be improved note that ions to be added are not limited to ions of hydrogen ions of helium or the like may be added further ions to be added are not limited to one kind of ions and plural kinds of ions may be added for example in the case of performing irradiation with hydrogen and helium concurrently using an ion doping apparatus the number of steps can be reduced as compared to the case of performing irradiation with hydrogen and helium in different steps and surface roughness of the single crystal semiconductor layer to be formed later can be suppressed note that heavy metal might be added when the embrittled region is formed with the ion doping apparatus however by performing the ion irradiation through the oxide film containing halogen atoms contamination of the single crystal semiconductor substrate due to the heavy metal can be prevented then the semiconductor substrate and the single crystal semiconductor substrate are disposed to face each other and are made to be closely attached to each other with the oxide film therebetween thus the semiconductor substrate and the single crystal semiconductor substrate can be bonded to each other see fig e note that an oxide film or a nitride film may be formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate to which the single crystal semiconductor substrate is attached when bonding is performed it is preferable that a pressure of greater than or equal to n/cm and less than or equal to n/cm e g a pressure of greater than or equal to n/cm and less than or equal to n/cm be applied to one part of the semiconductor substrate or one part of the single crystal semiconductor substrate when the bonding surfaces are made close to each other and disposed in close contact with each other by applying a pressure a bonding between the semiconductor substrate and the oxide film is generated at the part where the close contact is made and the bonding spontaneously spreads to almost the entire area this bonding is performed under the action of the van der waals force or hydrogen bonding and can be performed at room temperature note that before the single crystal semiconductor substrate and the semiconductor substrate are bonded to each other surfaces to be bonded to each other are preferably subjected to surface treatment surface treatment can improve the bonding strength at the interface between the single crystal semiconductor substrate and the semiconductor substrate as the surface treatment wet treatment dry treatment or a combination of wet treatment and dry treatment can be used alternatively wet treatment may be performed in combination with different wet treatment or dry treatment may be performed in combination with different dry treatment note that heat treatment for increasing the bonding strength may be performed after bonding this heat treatment is performed at a temperature at which separation at the embrittled region does not occur for example a temperature of greater than or equal to room temperature and less than c alternatively bonding of the semiconductor substrate and the oxide film may be performed while heating them at a temperature in the above range the heat treatment can be performed using a diffusion furnace a heating furnace such as a resistance heating furnace a rapid thermal annealing rta apparatus a microwave heating apparatus or the like the above temperature condition is merely an example and an embodiment of the disclosed invention should not be construed as being limited to this example next heat treatment is performed for separation of the single crystal semiconductor substrate at the embrittled region whereby a single crystal semiconductor layer is formed over the semiconductor substrate with the oxide film interposed therebetween fig f note that the temperature for the heat treatment in the separation is desirably as low as possible this is because as the temperature in the separation is low generation of roughness on the surface of the single crystal semiconductor layer can be suppressed specifically the temperature for the heat treatment in the separation may be greater than or equal to c and less than or equal to c and the heat treatment is more effective when the temperature is greater than or equal to c and less than or equal to c note that after the single crystal semiconductor substrate is separated the single crystal semiconductor layer may be subjected to heat treatment at greater than or equal to c so that concentration of hydrogen remaining in the single crystal semiconductor layer can be reduced next a surface of the single crystal semiconductor layer is irradiated with laser light whereby a single crystal semiconductor layer in which the flatness of the surface is improved and the number of defects is reduced is formed see fig g note that instead of the laser light irradiation treatment heat treatment may be performed although the laser light irradiation treatment is performed immediately after the heat treatment for separation of the single crystal semiconductor layer in this embodiment an embodiment of the present invention is not construed as being limited to this etching treatment may be performed after the heat treatment for separation of the single crystal semiconductor layer to remove a region where there are many defects on the surface of the single crystal semiconductor layer and then the laser light irradiation treatment may be performed alternatively after the surface flatness of the single crystal semiconductor layer is improved the laser light irradiation treatment may be performed note that the etching treatment may be either wet etching or dry etching further in this embodiment a step of reducing the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer may be performed after the laser light irradiation in order to reduce the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer any one of or both dry etching and wet etching may be employed through the above steps an soi substrate having the single crystal semiconductor layer with favorable characteristics can be obtained see fig g method for manufacturing semiconductor device next a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device using the soi substrate will be described with reference to figs a to e figs a to d figs a to d and figs a to c method for manufacturing transistor in lower portion first a manufacturing method of the transistor in the lower portion will be described with reference to figs a to e and figs a to d note that figs a to e and figs a to d illustrate part of the soi substrate formed by the method illustrated in figs a to g and are cross sectional views illustrating the steps for manufacturing the transistor in the lower portion illustrated in fig a first the single crystal semiconductor layer is processed into an island shape so that a semiconductor layer is formed see fig a note that before or after this step an impurity element imparting n type conductivity or an impurity element imparting p type conductivity may be added to the semiconductor layer in order to control the threshold voltage of the transistor in the case where silicon is used as the semiconductor phosphorus arsenic or the like can be used as the impurity element imparting n type conductivity on the other hand boron aluminum gallium or the like can be used as the impurity element imparting p type conductivity next an insulating layer is formed so as to cover the semiconductor layer see fig b the insulating layer is to be a gate insulating layer later the insulating layer can be formed for example by performing heat treatment thermal oxidation treatment thermal nitridation treatment or the like on a surface of the semiconductor layer instead of the heat treatment high density plasma treatment may be employed the high density plasma treatment can be performed using for example a mixed gas of any of a rare gas such as he ar kr or xe oxygen nitrogen oxide ammonia nitrogen and hydrogen needless to say the insulating layer may be formed using a cvd method a sputtering method or the like the insulating layer preferably has a single layer structure or a layered structure including any of silicon oxide silicon oxynitride silicon nitride hafnium oxide aluminum oxide tantalum oxide yttrium oxide hafnium silicate hfsixoy x y hafnium silicate to which nitrogen is added hfsixoynz x y z hafnium aluminate to which nitrogen is added hfalxoynz x y z and the like the thickness of the insulating layer may be for example greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm preferably greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm in this embodiment a single layer insulating layer containing silicon oxide is formed by a plasma cvd method next a mask is formed over the insulating layer and the impurity element imparting n type conductivity is added to the semiconductor layer so that the impurity region is formed see fig c note that the mask is removed after the impurity element is added next a mask is formed over the insulating layer and a region of the insulating layer that overlaps with the impurity region is partly removed so that the gate insulating layer a is formed see fig d part of the insulating layer can be removed by etching treatment such as wet etching or dry etching next a conductive layer for forming a gate electrode including a wiring formed using the same layer as the gate electrode is formed over the gate insulating layer a and is processed so that the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b are formed see fig e the conductive layer used for the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b can be formed using a metal material such as aluminum copper titanium tantalum or tungsten further the conductive layer may be formed using a semiconductor material such as polycrystalline silicon there is no particular limitation on the method for forming the conductive layer and a variety of film formation methods such as an evaporation method a cvd method a sputtering method or a spin coating method can be employed the conductive layer can be processed by etching using a resist mask next an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added to the semiconductor layer with the use of the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b as masks so that the channel formation region the impurity regions and the impurity region are formed see fig a here in the case of forming an n channel transistor an impurity element such as phosphorus p or arsenic as is added here the concentration of the impurity element to be added can be set as appropriate in addition after the impurity element is added heat treatment for activation is performed here the concentration of the impurity element in the impurity region is increased in the following order the impurity region the impurity region

nitride oxide silicon nitride or aluminum oxide in particular the insulating layer the insulating layer and the insulating layer are preferably formed using a low permittivity low k material because capacitance due to an overlapping electrode or wiring can be sufficiently reduced note that the insulating layer the insulating layer and the insulating layer may be porous insulating layers formed using any of these materials since the porous insulating layer has low permittivity as compared to a dense insulating layer capacitance due to an electrode or wiring can be further reduced alternatively the insulating layer the insulating layer and the insulating layer can be formed using an organic insulating material such as polyimide or acrylic in this embodiment the case of using silicon oxynitride for the insulating layer silicon nitride oxide for the insulating layer and silicon oxide for the insulating layer will be described a layered structure of the insulating layer the insulating layer and the insulating layer is employed here however an embodiment of the disclosed invention is not limited to this a single layer structure a layered structure of two layers or a layered structure of four or more layers may be used next the insulating layer and the insulating layer are subjected to chemical mechanical polishing cmp treatment or etching treatment so that the insulating layer and the insulating layer are flattened see fig c here cmp treatment is performed until the insulating layer is partly exposed when silicon nitride oxide is used for the insulating layer and silicon oxide is used for the insulating layer the insulating layer functions as an etching stopper next the insulating layer and the insulating layer are subjected to cmp treatment or etching treatment so that upper surfaces of the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b are exposed see fig d here etching treatment is performed until the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b are partly exposed for the etching treatment dry etching is preferably performed but wet etching may be performed in the step of partly exposing the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b in order to improve the characteristics of the transistor which is formed later the surfaces of the insulating layer the insulating layer and the insulating layer are preferably flattened as much as possible through the above steps the transistor in the lower portion can be formed see fig d note that before or after the above steps a step for forming an additional electrode wiring semiconductor layer or insulating layer may be performed for example by employing a multilayer wiring structure in which an insulating layer and a conductive layer are stacked as a wiring structure a highly integrated semiconductor device can be provided method for manufacturing transistor in upper portion next a method for manufacturing the transistor in the upper portion will be described with reference to figs a to d and figs a to c first an oxide semiconductor layer is formed over the gate electrode a the conductive layer b the insulating layer the insulating layer the insulating layer and the like and is processed so that the oxide semiconductor layer is formed see fig a note that an insulating layer functioning as a base may be formed over the insulating layer the insulating layer and the insulating layer before the oxide semiconductor layer is formed the insulating layer can be formed by a pvd method such as a sputtering method a cvd method such as a plasma cvd method or the like an oxide semiconductor to be used preferably contains at least indium in or zinc zn in particular both in and zn are preferably contained as a stabilizer for reducing variation in electric characteristics of a transistor including the oxide semiconductor gallium ga is preferably additionally contained tin sn is preferably contained as a stabilizer hafnium hf is preferably contained as a

eu gadolinium gd terbium tb dysprosium dy holmium ho erbium er thulium tm ytterbium yb and lutetium lu may be contained as the oxide semiconductor for example indium oxide tin oxide zinc oxide a two component metal oxide such as an in zn based oxide a sn zn based oxide an al zn based oxide a zn mg based oxide a sn mg based oxide an in mg based oxide or an in ga based oxide a three component metal oxide such as an in ga zn based oxide also referred to as igzo an in al zn based oxide an in sn zn based oxide a sn ga zn based oxide an al ga zn based oxide a sn al zn based oxide an in hf zn based oxide an in la zn based oxide an in ce zn based oxide an in pr zn based oxide an in nd zn based oxide an in sm zn based oxide an in eu zn based oxide an in gd zn based oxide an in tb zn based oxide an

based oxide an in hf ga zn based oxide an in al ga zn based oxide an in sn al zn based oxide an in sn hf zn based oxide or an in hf al zn based oxide can be used note that here for example an in ga zn based oxide means an oxide containing in ga and zn as its main components and there is no particular limitation on the ratio of in ga zn further a metal element in addition to in ga and zn may be contained as a material used for the oxide semiconductor layer a four component metal oxide material such as an in sn ga zn o based material a three component metal oxide material such as an in ga zn o based material an in sn zn o based material an in al zn o based material a sn ga zn o based material an al ga zn o based material or a sn al zn o based material a two component metal oxide material such as an in zn o based material a sn zn o based material an al zn o based material a zn mg o based material a sn mg o based material an in mg o based material or an in ga o based material or a single component metal oxide material such as an in o based material a sn o based material or a zn o based material can be used in addition the above materials may contain sio here for example an in ga zn o based material means an oxide film containing indium in gallium ga and zinc zn and there is no particular limitation on the composition ratio thereof further the in ga zn o based material may contain an element other than in ga and zn for example an in ga zn based oxide with an atomic ratio of in ga zn / / / or in ga zn / / / or any of oxides whose composition is in the neighborhood of the above compositions can be used alternatively an in sn zn based oxide with an atomic ratio of in sn zn / / / in sn zn / / / or in sn zn / / / or any of oxides whose composition is in the neighborhood of the above compositions may be used however without limitation to the materials given above a material with an appropriate composition may be used depending on needed semiconductor characteristics e

the atomic ratio between a metal element and oxygen the interatomic distance the density and the like be set to appropriate values for example high mobility can be obtained relatively easily in the case of using an in sn zn based oxide however also in the case of using an in ga zn based oxide mobility can be increased by reducing the defect density in a bulk note that for example the expression the composition of an oxide including in ga and zn at the atomic ratio of in ga zn a b c a b c is in the neighborhood of the composition of an oxide including in ga and zn at the atomic ratio of in ga zn a b c a b c means that a b and c satisfy the following relation a a b b c c ≤ r and r may be for example the same applies to other oxides the oxide semiconductor may be either single crystal or non single crystal in the latter case the oxide semiconductor may be either amorphous or polycrystalline further the oxide semiconductor may have either an amorphous structure including a portion having crystallinity or a non amorphous structure in the case of an oxide semiconductor in an amorphous state a flat surface can be obtained relatively easily so that when a transistor is manufactured with the use of such an oxide semiconductor interface scattering can be reduced and relatively high mobility can be obtained relatively easily in the case of an oxide semiconductor having crystallinity defects in a bulk can be further reduced and when a surface flatness is improved mobility of higher than that of an oxide semiconductor in an amorphous state can be obtained in order to improve the surface flatness the oxide semiconductor is preferably formed over a flat surface specifically the oxide semiconductor may be formed over a surface with an average surface roughness ra of less than or equal to nm preferably less than or equal to nm more preferably less than or equal to nm note that average surface roughness ra in this specification is obtained by three dimensionally expanding a centerline average roughness defined by jis b so as to be applied to a plane the ra can be expressed as an average value of absolute values of deviations from a reference plane to a designated plane and is defined by the following formula ra s ∫x x ∫y y fx⁢y z ⁢dxdyin formula s represents an area of a plane to be measured a rectangular region which is defined by four points represented by coordinates x y x y x y and x y and z represents an average height of the plane to be measured ra can be measured using an atomic force microscope afm as the oxide semiconductor layer a thin film including a material expressed as the chemical formula inmo zno m m can be used here m represents one or more metal elements selected from ga al mn and co for example m may be ga ga and al ga and mn ga and co or the like the thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer is preferably greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm this is because the transistor might be normally on when the oxide semiconductor layer is too thick e g when the thickness is greater than or equal to nm the oxide semiconductor layer is preferably formed by a method in which impurities such as hydrogen water a hydroxyl group or hydride do not enter the oxide semiconductor layer for example a sputtering method or the like can be used in the case where an in zn o based material is used as an oxide semiconductor a target therefor has a composition ratio of in zn to in an atomic ratio in o zno to in a molar ratio preferably in zn to in an atomic ratio in o zno to in a molar ratio more preferably in zn to in an atomic ratio in o zn to in a molar ratio for example in a target used for formation of an in zn o based oxide semiconductor which has an atomic ratio of in zn o x y z the relation of z x y is satisfied further an in sn zn based oxide can be referred to as itzo an oxide target which has an atomic ratio of in sn and zn of or the like is used in this embodiment the oxide semiconductor layer is formed by a sputtering method using an in ga zn o based oxide target as the in ga zn o based oxide target for example an oxide target having a composition ratio of in o ga o zno molar ratio can be used note that it is not necessary to limit the material and the composition ratio of the target to the above for example an oxide target having a composition ratio of in o ga o zno molar ratio can be used the filling rate of the oxide target is greater than or equal to and less than or equal to preferably greater than or equal to and less than or equal to with the use of the metal oxide target with a high filling rate a dense oxide semiconductor layer can be formed a film formation atmosphere may be a rare gas typically argon atmosphere an oxygen atmosphere or a mixed atmosphere containing a rare gas and oxygen an atmosphere of a high purity gas from which impurities such as hydrogen water a hydroxyl group or hydride are sufficiently removed is preferable in order to prevent hydrogen water a hydroxyl group hydride or the like from entering the oxide semiconductor layer for example the oxide semiconductor layer can be formed as follows first the substrate is held in a film formation chamber which is kept under reduced pressure and then is heated so that the substrate temperature reaches a temperature of greater than c and less than or equal to c preferably greater than c and less than or equal to c more preferably greater than or equal to c and less than or equal to c then a high purity gas from which impurities such as hydrogen water a hydroxyl group or hydride are sufficiently removed is introduced into the film formation chamber from which remaining moisture is being removed and the oxide semiconductor layer is formed over the substrate with the use of the target to remove moisture remaining in the film formation chamber an entrapment vacuum pump such as a cryopump an ion pump or a titanium sublimation pump is desirably used as an evacuation unit further an evacuation unit may be a turbo pump provided with a cold trap in the film formation chamber which is evacuated with a cryopump for example impurities such as hydrogen water a hydroxyl group or hydride preferably also a compound containing a carbon atom are removed whereby the concentration of impurities such as hydrogen water a hydroxyl group or hydride in the oxide semiconductor layer formed in the film formation chamber can be reduced in the case where the substrate temperature is low for example less than or equal to c during film formation a substance containing a hydrogen atom may enter the oxide semiconductor thus it is preferable that the substrate be heated at a temperature in the above range when the oxide semiconductor layer is formed with the substrate heated at the temperature described above since the substrate temperature is high hydrogen bonds are cut by heat and a substance containing a hydrogen atom is less likely to be taken into the oxide semiconductor layer therefore when the oxide semiconductor layer is formed with the substrate heated at the temperature described above the concentration of impurities such as hydrogen water a hydroxyl group or hydride in the oxide semiconductor layer can be sufficiently reduced moreover damage due to sputtering can be reduced as an example of film formation conditions the following conditions are employed the distance between the substrate and the target is mm the pressure is pa the direct current dc power is kw the substrate temperature is c and the film formation atmosphere is an oxygen atmosphere the proportion of the oxygen flow rate is note that a pulse direct current power source is preferable because powder substances also referred to as particles or dust generated in film formation can be reduced and the film thickness can be uniform note that before the oxide semiconductor layer is formed by a sputtering method powdery substances also referred to as particles or dust attached on a formation surface of the oxide semiconductor layer are preferably removed by reverse sputtering in which an argon gas is introduced and plasma is generated the reverse sputtering refers to a method in which voltage is applied to a substrate to generate plasma in the vicinity of the substrate to modify a surface on the substrate side note that instead of argon a gas of nitrogen helium oxygen or the like may be used the oxide semiconductor layer can be processed through the steps of forming a mask having a desired shape over the oxide semiconductor layer and etching the oxide semiconductor layer the mask may be formed by a method such as photolithography alternatively a method such as an inkjet method may be used to form the mask for the etching of the oxide semiconductor layer either wet etching or dry etching may be employed it is needless to say that both of them may be employed in combination after that heat treatment first heat treatment may be performed on the oxide semiconductor layer by performing the heat treatment a substance containing a hydrogen atom in the oxide semiconductor layer can be further removed the heat treatment is performed in an inert gas atmosphere at greater than or equal to c and less than or equal to c preferably greater than or equal to c and less than or equal to c or less than a strain point of the substrate the inert gas atmosphere is preferably an atmosphere which contains nitrogen or a rare gas e g helium neon or argon as its main component and does not contain water hydrogen or the like for example the purity of nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium neon or argon introduced into a heat treatment apparatus is greater than or equal to n preferably greater than or equal to n that is the concentration of the impurities is less than or equal to ppm preferably less than or equal to ppm the heat treatment can be performed in such a way that for example an object to be processed is introduced into an electric furnace in which a resistance heating element or the like is used and heated in a nitrogen atmosphere at c for one hour the oxide semiconductor layer is not exposed to the air during the heat treatment so that entry of water and hydrogen can be prevented the above heat treatment has an effect of removing hydrogen water and the like and can be referred to as dehydration treatment dehydrogenation treatment or the like the heat treatment can be performed for example before the oxide semiconductor layer is processed into an island shape or after the gate insulating layer is formed such dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment may be performed once or plural times next a conductive layer for forming a source electrode and a drain electrode including a wiring formed in the same layer as the source electrode and the drain electrode is formed over the oxide semiconductor layer and the like and is processed so that the source electrode a and the drain electrode b are formed see fig b the conductive layer can be formed by a pvd method or a cvd method as a material for the conductive layer an element selected from aluminum chromium copper tantalum titanium molybdenum and tungsten an alloy containing any of these elements as its component or the like can be used further one or more materials selected from manganese magnesium zirconium beryllium neodymium and scandium may be used the conductive layer can have a single layer structure or a layered structure including two or more layers for example the conductive layer can have a single layer structure of a titanium film or a titanium nitride film a single layer structure of an aluminum film containing silicon a two layer structure in which a titanium film is stacked over an aluminum film a two layer structure in which a titanium film is stacked over a titanium nitride film or a three layer structure in which a titanium film an aluminum film and a titanium film are stacked note that the conductive layer having a single layer structure of a titanium film or a titanium nitride film has an advantage in that it can be easily processed into the source electrode a and the drain electrode b each having a tapered shape alternatively the conductive layer may be formed using conductive metal oxide as the conductive metal oxide indium oxide in o tin oxide sno zinc oxide zno an alloy of indium oxide and tin oxide in o sno which is abbreviated to ito in some cases an alloy of indium oxide and zinc oxide in o zno or any of these metal oxide materials in which silicon or silicon oxide is contained can be used the conductive layer is preferably etched so that end portions of the source electrode a and the drain electrode b that are formed are tapered here a taper angle is for example preferably greater than or equal to and less than or equal to the etching is performed so that the end portions of the source electrode a and the drain electrode b are tapered whereby coverage with the gate insulating layer formed later can be improved and disconnection can be prevented the channel length l of the transistor in the upper portion is determined by a distance between lower end portions of the source electrode a and the drain electrode b note that for light exposure for forming a mask used in the case where a transistor with a channel length l of less than nm is formed it is preferable to use extreme ultraviolet light whose wavelength is as short as several nanometers to several tens of nanometers in the light exposure by extreme ultraviolet light the resolution is high and the focus depth is large for these reasons the channel length l of the transistor to be formed later can be in the range of greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm µm and the circuit can operate at higher speed moreover miniaturization can lead to lower power consumption of the semiconductor device as an example which is different from that in fig b oxide conductive layers can be provided as a source region and a drain region between the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrodes a material of the oxide conductive layer preferably contains zinc oxide as its component and preferably does not contain indium oxide for such an oxide conductive layer zinc oxide zinc aluminum oxide zinc aluminum oxynitride zinc gallium oxide or the like can be used for example the oxide conductive layers which serve as a source region and a drain region the source electrode a and the drain electrode b can be formed by forming an oxide conductive film over the oxide semiconductor layer forming a conductive layer over the oxide conductive film and processing the oxide conductive film and the conductive layer in one photolithography step alternatively a stacked layer of an oxide semiconductor film and an oxide conductive film is formed and the stacked layer is processed in one photolithography step so that the island shaped oxide semiconductor layer and oxide conductive film may be formed after the source electrode a and the drain electrode b are formed the island shaped oxide conductive film is etched using the source electrode a and the drain electrode b as masks so that the oxide conductive layers which serve as a source region and a drain region can be formed note that when etching treatment for processing the oxide conductive layer is performed etching conditions e g type of an etching agent the concentration of an etching agent and etching time are adjusted as appropriate in order to prevent excessive etching of the oxide semiconductor layer when oxide conductive layers are provided between the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrodes a source region and a drain region can have lower resistance and the transistor can operate at high speed with the structure including the oxide semiconductor layer the oxide conductive layer and the drain electrode formed using a metal material withstand voltage of the transistor can be further increased it is effective to use the oxide conductive layers for the source region and the drain region in order to improve frequency characteristics of a peripheral circuit a driver circuit the contact resistance can be reduced when a metal electrode e g molybdenum or tungsten and the oxide conductive layer are in contact with each other as compared to the case where a metal electrode e g molybdenum or tungsten and the oxide semiconductor layer are in contact with each other the contact resistance can be reduced by interposing the oxide conductive layers between the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrodes accordingly frequency characteristics of a peripheral circuit a driver circuit can be improved next the gate insulating layer is formed so as to cover the source electrode a and the drain electrode b and to be in contact with part of the oxide semiconductor layer see fig c the gate insulating layer can be formed by a cvd method a sputtering method or the like the gate insulating layer is preferably formed to contain silicon oxide silicon nitride silicon oxynitride gallium oxide aluminum oxide tantalum oxide hafnium oxide yttrium oxide hafnium silicate hfsixoy x y hafnium silicate to which nitrogen is added hfsixoynz x y z hafnium aluminate to which nitrogen is added hfalxoynz x y z or the like the gate insulating layer may have a single layer structure or a layered structure in which these materials are combined there is no particular limitation on the thickness however in the case where the semiconductor device is miniaturized the thickness is preferably small for ensuring an operation of the transistor for example in the case where silicon oxide is used the thickness can be set to greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm preferably greater than or equal to nm and less than or equal to nm when the gate insulating layer is thin as in the above description a problem of gate leakage current due to a tunneling effect or the like is caused in order to solve the problem of gate leakage current a high permittivity high k material such as hafnium oxide tantalum oxide yttrium oxide hafnium silicate hfsixoy x y hafnium silicate to which nitrogen is added hfsixoynz x y z or hafnium aluminate to which nitrogen is added hfalxoynz x y z is preferably used for the gate insulating layer by using a high k material for the gate insulating layer electric characteristics can be ensured and the thickness can be large to prevent gate leakage current note that a layered structure of a film containing a high k material and a film containing any one of silicon oxide silicon nitride silicon oxynitride silicon nitride oxide aluminum oxide and the like may be employed further the insulating layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer in this embodiment the gate insulating layer may be formed using an insulating material containing a group element and oxygen many oxide semiconductor materials contain a group element and thus an insulating material containing a group element works well with the oxide semiconductor by using such an insulating material for the insulating layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor an interface with the oxide semiconductor can be kept in a favorable state an insulating material containing a group element means an insulating material containing one or more group elements as an insulating material containing a group element gallium oxide aluminum oxide aluminum gallium oxide gallium aluminum oxide and the like are given here aluminum gallium oxide is a material in which the amount of aluminum is larger than that of gallium in atomic percent and gallium aluminum oxide is a material in which the amount of gallium is larger than that of aluminum in atomic percent for example in the case of forming a gate insulating layer in contact with an oxide semiconductor layer containing gallium a material containing gallium oxide may be used as the gate insulating layer so that favorable characteristics can be maintained at the interface between the oxide semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer when the oxide semiconductor layer and the insulating layer containing gallium oxide are provided in contact with each other pileup of hydrogen at the interface between the oxide semiconductor layer and the insulating layer can be reduced note that a similar effect can be obtained in the case where an element belonging to the same group as a constituent element of the oxide semiconductor is used for the insulating layer for example it is also effective to form an insulating layer with the use of a material containing aluminum oxide aluminum oxide has a property of not easily transmitting water thus it is preferable to use the material containing aluminum oxide in terms of preventing entry of water into the oxide semiconductor layer the insulating layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer preferably contains oxygen in a proportion higher than that in the stoichiometric proportion by heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere or oxygen doping oxygen doping refers to addition of oxygen into a bulk note that the term bulk is used in order to clarify that oxygen is added not only to a surface of a thin film but also to the inside of the thin film in addition oxygen doping includes oxygen plasma doping in which oxygen which is made to be plasma is added to a bulk the oxygen doping may be performed using an ion implantation method or an ion doping method for example in the case where the insulating layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer is formed of gallium oxide the composition of gallium oxide can be set to be ga ox x α α by heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere or oxygen doping in the case where the insulating layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer is formed of aluminum oxide the composition of aluminum oxide can be set to be al ox x α α by heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere or oxygen doping in the case where the insulating layer in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer is formed of gallium aluminum oxide aluminum gallium oxide the composition of gallium aluminum oxide aluminum gallium oxide can be set to be gaxal xo α x α by heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere or oxygen doping by oxygen doping or the like an insulating layer including a region where the proportion of oxygen is higher than that in the stoichiometric proportion can be formed when the insulating layer including such a region is in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer oxygen that exists excessively in the insulating layer is supplied to the oxide semiconductor layer and oxygen deficiency in the oxide semiconductor layer or at an interface between the oxide semiconductor layer and the insulating layer is reduced the insulating layer including a region where the proportion of oxygen is higher than that in the stoichiometric proportion may be applied to an insulating layer serving as a base film of the oxide semiconductor layer instead of the gate insulating layer or both the gate insulating layer and the base film after the gate insulating layer is formed second heat treatment is desirably performed in an inert gas atmosphere or an oxygen atmosphere the temperature of the heat treatment is greater than or equal to c and less than or equal to c preferably greater than or equal to c and less than or equal to c for example the heat treatment may be performed at c for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere the second heat treatment can reduce variation in electric characteristics of the transistor further in the case where the gate insulating layer contains oxygen oxygen is supplied to the oxide semiconductor layer which has been subjected to the dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment to compensate for oxygen deficiency in the oxide semiconductor layer so that an i type intrinsic or substantially i type oxide semiconductor layer can be formed note that in this embodiment the second heat treatment is performed after the gate insulating layer is formed the timing of the second heat treatment is not limited thereto for example the second heat treatment may be performed after the gate electrode is formed alternatively the second heat treatment may be performed following the first heat treatment the first heat treatment may double as the second heat treatment or the second heat treatment may double as the first heat treatment next a conductive layer for forming a gate electrode including a wiring formed using the same layer as the gate electrode is formed and is processed so that the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b are formed see fig d the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b can be formed using a metal material such as molybdenum titanium tantalum tungsten aluminum copper neodymium or scandium or an alloy material containing any of these materials as its main component note that the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b may have a single layer structure or a layered structure next the insulating layer is formed over the gate insulating layer the gate electrode a and the conductive layer b see fig a the insulating layer can be formed by a pvd method a cvd method or the like the insulating layer can be formed using a material including an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide silicon oxynitride silicon nitride hafnium oxide gallium oxide or aluminum oxide note that for the insulating layer a material with a low permittivity may be preferably used or a structure with a low permittivity e g a porous structure may be preferably employed this is because by reducing the permittivity of the insulating layer capacitance between wirings and electrodes can be reduced which will increase operation speed note that although the insulating layer has a single layer structure in this embodiment an embodiment of the disclosed invention is not limited to this the insulating layer may have a layered structure including two or more layers next an opening reaching the source electrode a is formed in the gate insulating layer and the insulating layer then the wiring connected to the source electrode a is formed over the insulating layer see fig b the opening is formed by selective etching using a mask or the like a conductive layer is formed by a pvd method or a cvd method and then is patterned so that the wiring is formed as a material for the conductive layer an element selected from aluminum chromium copper tantalum titanium molybdenum and tungsten an alloy containing any of these elements as its component or the like can be used further one or more materials selected from manganese magnesium zirconium beryllium neodymium and scandium may be used specifically it is possible to employ a method for example in which a thin titanium film about nm is formed in a region including the opening of the insulating layer by a pvd method and an aluminum film is formed to fill the opening after the thin titanium film is formed by a pvd method here the titanium film formed by a pvd method has a function of reducing an oxide film e g a native oxide film formed on a surface where the titanium film is formed to decrease contact resistance with a lower electrode here the source electrode a in addition hillock of the aluminum film can be prevented a copper film may be formed by a plating method after the formation of the barrier film of titanium titanium nitride or the like the opening formed in the insulating layer is preferably formed in a region overlapping with the conductive layer b with the opening in such a region the element area can be prevented from increasing owing to a contact region a position where the impurity region and the source electrode a are connected and a position where the source electrode a and the wiring are connected may overlap with each other without using the conductive layer b such a case will be described in that case an opening also referred to as a contact in a lower portion is formed in the insulating layer the insulating layer and the insulating layer that are formed over the impurity region and the source electrode a is formed in the contact in the lower portion after that an opening also referred to as a contact in an upper portion is formed in a region overlapping with the contact in the lower portion in the gate insulating layer and the insulating layer and then the wiring is formed when the contact in the upper portion is formed in the region overlapping with the contact in the lower portion the source electrode a formed in the contact in the lower portion might be disconnected by etching in order to avoid the disconnection the contact in the lower portion and the contact in the upper portion may be formed so as not to overlap with each other but a problem of the increase in the element area occurs as described in this embodiment with the use of the conductive layer b the contact in the upper portion can be formed without disconnection of the source electrode a thus the contact in the lower portion and the contact in the upper portion can be formed overlapping with each other so that the element area can be prevented from increasing owing to a contact region in other words the degree of integration of the semiconductor device can be increased next the insulating layer is formed so as to cover the wiring see fig c through the above process the capacitor and the transistor including the highly purified oxide semiconductor layer are completed see fig c since the oxide semiconductor layer is a highly purified oxide semiconductor layer in the transistor described in this embodiment the hydrogen concentration thereof is less than or equal to × atoms/cm preferably less than or equal to × atoms/cm more preferably less than or equal to × atoms/cm in addition the value of the carrier density of the oxide semiconductor layer is sufficiently low e g less than × /cm preferably less than × /cm as compared with that of a general silicon wafer approximately × /cm accordingly the off state current is also sufficiently small for example the off state current here current per micrometer µm of channel width of the transistor at room temperature c is less than or equal to za za zeptoampere is × a preferably less than or equal to za with the use of the highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor layer the off state current of the transistor can be sufficiently reduced

hexagonal atomic arrangement when seen from the direction of an a b plane a surface or an interface will be described in the crystal metal atoms are arranged in a layered manner or metal atoms and oxygen atoms are arranged in a layered manner along the c axis and the direction of the a axis or the b axis is varied in the a b plane the crystal rotates around the c axis in a broad sense an oxide

to the a b plane and in which metal atoms are arranged in a layered manner or metal atoms and oxygen atoms are arranged in a layered manner when seen from the direction perpendicular to the c axis direction the caac is not a single crystal but this does not mean that the caac is composed of only an amorphous component although the caac includes a crystallized portion crystalline portion a boundary between one crystalline portion and another crystalline portion is not clear in some cases in the case where oxygen is included in the caac nitrogen may be substituted for part of oxygen included in the caac the c axes of individual crystalline portions included in the caac may be aligned in one direction e g a direction perpendicular to a surface of a substrate over which the caac is

figs a to e figs a to c and figs a to c in figs a to e figs a to c and figs a to c the vertical direction corresponds to the c axis direction and a plane perpendicular to the c axis direction corresponds to the a b plane unless otherwise specified when the expressions an upper half and a lower half are simply used they mean an upper half above the a b plane and a lower half below the a b plane an upper half and a lower half with respect to the a b plane fig a illustrates a structure including one hexacoordinate in atom and six tetracoordinate oxygen hereinafter referred to as tetracoordinate o atoms proximate to the in atom here a structure including one metal atom and oxygen atoms proximate thereto is referred to as a small group the structure in fig a is actually an octahedral structure but is illustrated as a planar structure for simplicity note that three tetracoordinate o atoms exist in each of an upper half and a lower half in fig a in the small group

of the tetracoordinate o atoms below the metal atom is equal to the number of the metal atoms proximate to and above each of the tetracoordinate o atoms since the coordination number of the tetracoordinate o atom is the sum of the number of the metal atoms proximate to and below the o atom and the number of the metal atoms proximate to and above the o atom is accordingly when the sum of the number of tetracoordinate o atoms above a metal atom and the number of tetracoordinate o atoms below another metal atom is the two kinds of small groups including the metal atoms can be bonded for

that in fig a embodiment in this embodiment mobility of the transistor including an oxide semiconductor for a channel formation region which has been described in embodiments to will be described the actually measured field effect mobility of an insulated gate transistor can be lower than its original mobility because of a variety of reasons this phenomenon occurs not only in the case of using an oxide semiconductor one of the reasons that reduce the mobility is a defect inside a semiconductor or a defect at an interface between the semiconductor and an insulating film when a levinson model is used the field effect mobility on the assumption that no defect exists inside the semiconductor can be calculated theoretically assuming that the original mobility and the measured field effect mobility of a semiconductor are µ and µ respectively and a potential barrier such as a grain boundary exists in the semiconductor the measured field effect mobility can be expressed as the following formula μ μ exp ekthere e represents the height of the potential barrier k represents the boltzmann constant and t represents the absolute temperature when the potential barrier is assumed to be attributed to a defect the height of the potential barrier can be expressed as the following formula according to the levinson model e e ⁢n ⁢εn e ⁢n ⁢t ⁢εcox⁢vghere e represents the elementary electric charge n represents the average defect density per unit area in a channel formation region ε represents the permittivity of the semiconductor n represents the number of carriers per unit area in the channel formation region cox represents the capacitance per unit area vg represents the gate voltage and t represents the thickness of the channel formation region in the case where the thickness of the semiconductor layer is less than or equal to nm the thickness of the channel formation region may be regarded as being the same as the thickness of the semiconductor layer the drain

calculated to be cm /vs from formula and formula the measured mobility of an in sn zn oxide including a defect is approximately cm /vs however assuming that no defect exists inside the semiconductor and at the interface between the semiconductor and an insulating film the mobility µ of the oxide semiconductor is expected to be cm /vs note that even when no defect exists inside a semiconductor scattering at an interface between a channel formation region and a gate insulating layer affects the transport property of the transistor in other words the mobility µ at a position that is distance

hydrogen a hydroxyl group or moisture to be released and removed from the oxide semiconductor film in this manner the field effect mobility can be improved such an improvement in field effect mobility is presumed to be achieved not only by removal of impurities by dehydration or dehydrogenation but also by a reduction in interatomic distance due to an increase in density the oxide semiconductor can be crystallized by being highly purified by removal of impurities from the oxide semiconductor in the case of using such a highly purified non single crystal oxide semiconductor ideally a field effect

oxide semiconductor hydrogen a hydroxyl group or moisture contained in the oxide semiconductor is released by heat treatment and the oxide semiconductor is crystallized through the heat treatment or by another heat treatment performed later by such crystallization treatment or recrystallization treatment a non single crystal oxide semiconductor having favorable crystallinity can be obtained the intentional heating of the substrate during film formation and/or the heat treatment after the film formation contributes not only to improving field effect mobility but also to making the transistor normally off in a transistor in which an oxide semiconductor film that contains in sn and zn as main components and is formed without heating a substrate intentionally is used as a channel formation region the threshold voltage tends to be shifted negatively however when the oxide semiconductor film formed while heating the substrate intentionally is used the problem of the negative shift of the

bias stress can be increased for example when a gate bias is applied with an intensity of mv/cm at c for one hour drift of the threshold voltage can be less than ± v preferably less than ± v a bt test was performed on the following two transistors sample on which heat treatment was not performed after formation of an oxide semiconductor film and sample on which heat treatment at c was performed after formation of an oxide semiconductor film first vg id characteristics of the transistors were measured at a substrate temperature of c and vd of v note that vd refers to drain voltage a potential difference between a drain and a source then the substrate temperature was set to c and vd was set to v after that v of vg was applied so that the intensity of an electric field applied to gate insulating layers was mv/cm and the condition was kept for one hour next vg was set to v then vg id characteristics of the transistors were measured at a substrate temperature of c and vd of v this process is called a positive bt test in a similar manner first vg id characteristics of the transistors were measured at a substrate temperature of c and vd of v then the substrate temperature was set to c and vd was set to v after that v of vg was applied so that the intensity of an electric field applied to the gate insulating layers was mv/cm and the condition was kept for one hour next vg was

to the positive bt test and that due to the negative bt test were v and v respectively it is found that in each of sample and sample the amount of shift in the threshold voltage between before and after the bt tests is small and the reliability thereof is high the heat treatment can be performed in an oxygen atmosphere alternatively the heat treatment may be performed first in an atmosphere of nitrogen or an inert gas or under reduced pressure and then in an atmosphere containing oxygen oxygen is supplied to the oxide semiconductor after dehydration or dehydrogenation whereby an effect of the heat treatment can be further increased as a method for supplying oxygen after dehydration or dehydrogenation a method in which oxygen ions are accelerated by an electric field and implanted into the oxide semiconductor film may be employed a defect due to oxygen deficiency is easily caused in the oxide semiconductor or at an interface between the oxide semiconductor and a film in contact with the oxide semiconductor however when excess oxygen is contained in the oxide semiconductor by the heat treatment oxygen deficiency caused constantly can be compensated for with excess oxygen the excess oxygen is oxygen existing mainly between lattices when the concentration of excess oxygen is set to greater than or equal to × /cm and less than or equal to × /cm excess oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor without causing crystal distortion or the like when heat treatment is performed so that at least part of the oxide semiconductor includes crystal a more stable oxide semiconductor film can be obtained for example when an oxide semiconductor film which is formed by sputtering using a target having a composition ratio of in sn zn without heating a substrate intentionally is analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd a halo pattern is observed the formed oxide semiconductor film can be crystallized by being subjected to heat treatment the temperature of the heat treatment can be set as appropriate when the heat treatment is performed at c for example a clear diffraction peak can be observed in an x ray diffraction an xrd analysis of an in sn zn o film was conducted the xrd analysis was conducted using an x ray diffractometer d advance manufactured by bruker axs and measurement was performed by an out of plane method sample a and sample b were prepared and the xrd analysis was performed thereon a method for manufacturing sample a and sample b will be described below an in sn zn o film with a thickness of nm was formed over a quartz substrate that had been subjected to dehydrogenation treatment the in sn zn o film was formed with a sputtering apparatus with a power of w dc in an oxygen atmosphere an in sn zn o target having an atomic ratio of in sn zn was used as a target note that the substrate heating temperature in film formation was set to c a sample manufactured in this manner was used as sample a next a sample manufactured by a method similar to that of sample a was subjected to heat treatment at c as the heat treatment heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere was first performed for one hour and heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere was further performed for one hour without lowering the temperature a sample manufactured in this manner was used as sample b fig shows xrd spectra of sample a and sample b no peak derived from crystal was observed in sample a whereas peaks derived from crystal were observed when θ was around deg and at deg to deg in sample b as described above by intentionally heating the substrate during deposition of an oxide semiconductor containing in sn and zn as main components and/or by performing heat treatment after the deposition characteristics of a transistor can be improved these substrate heating and heat treatment have an effect of preventing hydrogen and a hydroxyl group which are unfavorable impurities for an oxide semiconductor from being contained in the film or an effect of removing hydrogen and a hydroxyl group from the film that is an oxide semiconductor can be highly purified by removing hydrogen serving as a donor impurity from the oxide semiconductor whereby a normally off transistor can be obtained the high purification of an oxide semiconductor enables the off state current of the transistor to be less than or equal to aa/µm here the unit of the off state current is used to indicate current per micrometer of a channel width fig shows a relation between the off state current of a transistor and the inverse of substrate temperature absolute temperature at measurement here for simplicity the abscissa represents a value /t obtained by multiplying an inverse of substrate temperature at measurement by specifically as shown in fig the off

respectively preferably the off state current can be less than or equal to aa/µm × a/µm less than or equal to za/µm × a/µm and less than or equal to za/µm × a/µm when the substrate temperatures is c c and room temperature respectively note that in order to prevent hydrogen and moisture from being contained in the oxide semiconductor film during formation thereof it is preferable to increase the purity of a sputtering gas by sufficiently suppressing leakage from the outside of a film formation chamber and degasification through an inner wall of the film formation chamber for example a gas with a dew point of less than or equal to c is preferably used as the sputtering gas in order to prevent moisture from being contained in the film in addition it is preferable to use a target which is highly purified so as not to contain impurities such as hydrogen and moisture although it is possible to remove moisture from a film of an oxide semiconductor containing in sn and zn as main components by heat treatment a film which does not contain moisture originally is preferably formed because moisture is released from the oxide semiconductor containing in sn and zn as main components at a higher temperature than from an oxide semiconductor containing in ga and zn as main components the relation between the substrate temperature and electric characteristics of a transistor formed using sample b on which heat treatment at c was performed after formation of the oxide semiconductor film was evaluated the transistor used for the measurement has a channel length l of µm a channel

dependence of id a solid line and field effect mobility a dotted line fig a shows a relation between the substrate temperature and the threshold voltage and fig b shows a relation between the substrate temperature and the field effect mobility from fig a it is found that the threshold voltage gets lower as the substrate temperature increases note that the threshold voltage is decreased from v to v in the range from c to c from fig b it is found that the field effect mobility gets lower as the substrate temperature increases note that the field effect mobility is decreased from cm /vs to cm /vs in the range from c to c thus it is found that variation in electric characteristics is small in the above temperature range in a transistor in which such an oxide semiconductor containing in sn and zn as main components is used as a channel formation region a field effect mobility of greater than or equal to cm /vsec preferably greater than or equal to cm /vsec more preferably greater than or equal to cm /vsec can be obtained with the off state current maintained at less than or equal to aa/µm which can achieve on state current needed for an lsi for example in an fet where l/w is nm/ nm an on state current of greater than or equal to µa can flow when the gate voltage is v and the drain voltage is v in addition sufficient electric characteristics can be ensured in a temperature range needed for an operation of a transistor with such characteristics an integrated circuit having a novel function can be realized without decreasing the operation speed even when
